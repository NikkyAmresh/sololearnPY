            A Regular Expression is a pattern used for searching strings.

Regex Patterns are always between two forward slashes, "/" example: /pattern/

A Pattern's root is usually some sort of string. Let's say this string is identified as the letter, "n"

You can search if a string contains the word "Hi" by /hi/ however this will return a match also for words that contain the letters "hi" together like, "this", "hit", or "hide"

at the end of regex patterns there are 3 modifiers. I, G, and M
i - makes the pattern case insensitive, so the pattern matches Hi, hi, hI, or HI

g - returns all the matches, otherwise the regex pattern only searches for the first occurance

m - multi line searching, pretty self explanatory.

There are special characters and variables for patterns too.

"." represents any character except form feed characters

"\0" stands for the null character 

"\s" represents whitespace characters

"\S" represents any non whitespace characters 

"\f" represents any form feed characters

"\d" represents any digit or number characters

"\D" represents any non digit or non number characters 

"|" the or operator, /x|y/ searches if a string contains the letter x or y and returns all matches.

"\t" tab characters
"\n" line breaks
"\v" vertical tab characters

"\uXXXX" is replaced with the unicode value given where 'XXXX' represents the Unicode number

and there are a few other things useful to making efficient patterns

\b - The block tag, its used as, /\bHi\b/i
this pattern will search for the word, "Hi" and won't return other words that contain "hi"

[^n] - Doesn't contain, the letter n can be replaced with characters, A-Za-z or 0-9 or specific characters like /[^hduvXQ]/ and returns true if the string doesn't contain those characters

[n] - Same as the other just reversed, returns true if the string does contain those characters

^n - Returns true if the string starts with the variable, n so /^hello/i would return true if used on the string "Hello World!"

n$ - Returns true if the string ends with the variable, n
 
n{x} - Returns true if n is repeated x times, so /l{3}/ would return true on "Helllo World!"

n{x, } - Returns true if n is repeated x or more times

n?=x - Returns true if n is followed by x at any point in the string

n?!x - Returns true if n isn't followed by x at any point in the string

Any Questions? I can explain anything in more detail if you are confused on anything.

These patterns can be used in methods like:

String.replace(/\bFuck\b/ig, "***");
to replace all occurrences of the word, fuck

String.search(/\bFuck\b/ig,);
see if string contains the word fuck

var x = String.match(/\bFuck\b/ig);
x.length
returns how many occurrences of the word, fuck
