                <h3>Which language should I learn first?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>That strongly depends on what you want to do.<br>
                    For web development start with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
                    For beginning with programming in general, choose Python or Ruby.<br>
                    If you want to program Android apps, Java is your best choice.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>What is XYZ?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Please use <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> to get the information you need.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>What's the difference between x++ and ++x / x-- and --x?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>++x increments the value of x (x = x + 1) and then uses it.<br>
                    x++ uses the value of x before increasing it.<br>
                    -- decreases the value (x = x - 1).</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
                    <code>x=5; // x is 5<br>
                    cout&lt;&lt;x++; // outputs 5, but x is now 6</code><br><br>
                    <code>x=5; // x is 5<br>
                    cout&lt;&lt;++x; // x is now 6, outputs 6</code></p>

                <h3>Can I use the certificates for job applications?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>No.<br>
                    These certificates aren't official. Since you can use hints and have unlimited tries to answer the questions, everyone eventually gets the certficates.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Why is there no course for XYZ?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>There are a lot of programming languages out there. If you think one particular language is missing, use the feedback form to suggest it. You'll find it in the app in the menu (top right corner).</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Why is there no challenge for XYZ?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>SQL:</strong> Maybe because the questions would be way to long as you'd need to have the contents and structure of a database to relate the questions to.</p>
                    <p><strong>CSS:</strong> You'll find questions about CSS in the HTML challenges. CSS won't work without HTML so it makes perfectly sense.</p>
                    <p><strong>Others:</strong> Maybe SoloLearn will add them in the future. Just be patient.</p>

                <h3>How do I learn to hack?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Just. Don't.<br>
                    If you really want to learn how to hack, learn C-languages and become familiar with the system. You'd have to learn the rest by yourself or somewhere else. But please don't become a so called skript kiddy!</p>

                <h3>What are challenges in SoloLearn? How do they work?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Challenges are initiated by challenging another user in the Challenge section using a certain weapon (language). Challenges consist of 5 relevant programming questions which has to be completed by both users within a limited amount of time. The user with the most correct answers wins. If both sides get equal amount of correct answers, the challenge ends in a draw.</p>
                    <p>After initiating and completing 5 questions of the challenge session, the user who initiated the challenge will have to wait until the other user comes online and accept the challenge. Users have the option to decline the challenge. If the other user does not respond to the challenge invitation, the challenge will simply expire.</p>
                    <p>Users gain XP for winning challenges, and lose XP for losing challenges. The base algorithm of the XP system in challenges is as such:<br>
                    Lose XP = 32 - Win XP</p>
                    <p>Answer bonus may also be given to beginners.<br>

                <h3>What is the modulus operator (%)?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>The modulus operator calculates the remainder of an integer division.<br>
                    For example: 5 % 3 = 2 because 3 fits once into 5 and 5 - (3 * 1) = 2<br>
                    Another example: 21 % 4 = 1; 21 - (4 * 5) = 1<br>
                    And another: 15 % 5 = 0; 15 - (5 * 3) = 0</p>

                <h3>Can I create games in language XYZ?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Of course. Back in the days when operating systems didn't have fancy GUIs, there where a lot of text based games. These can be played in the console. If you prefer graphic based games, there are tutorials on how to make clones of Tetris, Pong or Snake with HTML5/JS, Java, C++ and others. Or try to make a quiz game like &quot;Who wants to be a millionaire?&quot; with HTML5, JavaScript, PHP and mySQL.</p>
                    <p>You can find some examples in the <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Codes?ordering=MostPopular&query=game&language=">code playground</a>.</p>

                    <p>Most people here prefer to get in contact with you at the Q&A section. If you really want them to join - write a good code to show your skills and invite them to yoin your group there.<br>

                <h3>Why should I comment my code?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Use comments as a documentation for your code. They'll help you (and others) to understand what parts of the code does. This comes in handy when you re-read your code after several months or if others want to understand your code.</p>
                    <p>You can use comments also for debugging. Just comment out the faulty lines and try to run your program again. You can then remove the comment step by step until you find the error. Or maybe you need to enter a username and password to run your program, just comment out the login, so you can use your program without any credentials.</p>
                    <p>You'll find an overview of how to comment in different languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

                <h3>What's the difference between Java and JavaScript?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Java is a programming language running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), whereas JavaScript is a scripting language interpreted by a web browser. They only have the name in common as Java was very popular when JavaScript was created and the developers of JavaScript thought it would make their language equally popular when they put Java into its name.</p>

                <h3>What's the difference between id and class?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>An id is unique. It refers to one element. It may occure only once in the document.</p>
                    <p>Classes define several related elements. If a class is addressed (e.g. by CSS or JavaScript) all elements belonging to that class are affected.</p>

                        It's used to group inline-elements in a document. It provides no visual change by itself. It provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can use it to style parts of your document individually without using other, semantically not fitting tags. &lt;span&gt; is also often used for interaction with JavaScript or to insert images from an image sprite via CSS.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>It's a variable used as iterator/index. It doesn't have to be i, it could be a, iterator, index, somethingelse, oewbgwogncvewg or any other valid variable name.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sample code:</strong><br>
                    <code>for i in range(1,10):<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print i</code>

                <div>
                    <p>They're both used for division, / results in a float division, whereas // results in an integer division.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example (only Python3; in Python2 both would result in integers unless at least one operand is a float):</strong></p>
                    <p>10 / 3 = 3.3333333333333335</p>
                    <p>10 // 3 = 3</p>
