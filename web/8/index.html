    <p>Well, HTML5 has been great, for creating
     interesting webpages and enhanced graphics and
      especially with CSS3, it allows usage of JQuery API’s and many more. Lot of new tags came
       in like <em>&lt;header&gt;</em>,
     <em>&lt;footer&gt;</em>
      and <em>&lt;nav&gt;</em>.
       Lots of new functionalities came in like
        geolocation or drag and drop API’s and
     enhanced local storage. Developers and
       designers have used above features
  extensively to create new applications
         as well as lot of migration has also
          happened.</p>
       <p>But the rate at which the technology is speeding up had never been this fast. A graphic designer or a web developer has to update themselves every now and then. So knowing one technology well is good but not the requirement of time, instead ability to grasp quickly is the key!!!</p>

       <p>So here I would like to peek into what possibly to expect from html6, and what is being talked about of the same.</p>
       <p>
       <strong>Concept of sponsored/User Defined Tags</strong>
       <br /> An easy to use and express tag, a better mark-up technique is one of the features. For e.g. 
       <em>&lt;div&gt;</em> 
       tag has been used with multiple id’s like a wrapper or container, instead of marking up specifically by rules, you can mark it as <em>&lt;wrapper&gt;</em>
        or a<em> &lt;container&gt;</em> directly. Imagine using tags like <em>&lt;logo&gt;&lt;/logo&gt;</em> to mark up your logo or using <em>&lt;breadcrumb&gt;&lt;/breadcrumb&gt;</em> or <em>&lt;toolbar&gt;&lt;/toolbar&gt;</em> and you can define all these tags using CSS4.</p>
       <p>Basically, this concept is like HTML with namespaces like XML, so HTML is used to customized tags.
        Entities/organizations can register and sponsor tags.
        This kind of mark-up will eventually provide complete independence to designers and developers.</p>

       </p>
       <p>
       <strong>Requirements and Results</strong>
       <br />
       Latest versions of browsers will be required or even an update for all browsers will pop in, once html6 is in the picture. Security will be enhanced, peer to peer file transfer will be enabled and many such features will come into play. As for the output quality, security and coding techniques provide quicker and better graphical web pages or applications.
       </p>
           
       <p>At Azilen we explore and innovate, and one of the definite area which looks like it is expanding from HTML5 to a more evolved web technology!!</p>
