<text align="center">
<p> Ah ah <br/>
Ah ah<br/>
Ah ah</p>

<p>The sky is a neighborhood<br/>
So keep it down<br/>
heart is a storybook<br/>
A star burned out<p/>

<p>The sky is a neighborhood<br/>
Don't make a sound<br/>
Lights coming up ahead<br/>
Don't look now</p>

<p>The sky is a neighborhood<br/>
The sky is a neighborhood<br/>
Don't look now</p>

<p> my dear Heaven is a big band now<br/>
Gotta get to sleep somehow<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Keep it down<p/>

<p>Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now<br/>
Gotta get to sleep somehow<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Keep it down</p>

<p>Mind is a battlefield<br/>
All hope is gone<br/>
Trouble to the right and left<br/>
Whose side you're on?</p>

<p>Thoughts like a minefield<br/>
I'm a ticking bomb<br/>
Maybe you should watch your step<br/>
Don't get lost</p>

<p>The sky is a neighborhood<br/>
The sky is a neighborhood<br/>
Don't get lost</p>


<p>Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now<br/>
Gotta get to sleep somehow<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Keep it down</p>

<p>Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now<br/>
Gotta get to sleep somehow<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Keep it down</p>

<p>Oh my dear Heaven is a big band now<br/>
Gotta get to sleep somehow (The sky is a neighborhood) <br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Bangin' on the ceiling<br/>
Keep it down</p>

<p>The sky is a neighborhood</p>
